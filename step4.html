                    <p align="center">First of all , I would like to thank you for shortlisting me. Hospet.online website is working fine and is designed in a good way.But as we know that we need to update some things with time , we need to look after them , improve them and make them better time to time. In the same way, website needs improvement.The following things I plan to do:-
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>First of all we need to add a Home page and we need to make the Icon of website little bit larger and attractive.</li>
                        <li>As I mentioned there is a problem when we hover on links on top left corner,So I can fix that as well.</li>
                        <li>About sub-headings in the website, I will make them more attractive and will add icon with them so that user feels good while visiting our website.</li>
                        <li>Footer needs to be more stylish and attractive which I can easily do because I have practice in designing headers and footers.</li>
                        <li>Like weather page is properly developed and given a proper heading ,I will make sure that each page looks good and page content is properly aligned.</li>
                        <li>Will help in compeleting the directory page which is not upadated.</li>
                        <li>Will align the advertisement assignment in proper way as per your requirement.</li>
                        <li>Will re-design the parts of website so that will look better and will be attractive.</li>
                        <li>Will make the website more responsive so that when we change the screen size no unusual things happen.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p align="center">I assure you that I will try to fulfil all your requirements. We will together try to add some more good features to Website.
                    <br>
